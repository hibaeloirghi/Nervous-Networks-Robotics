# Nervous-Networks-Robotics
Exploring computational models of simple nervous systems.

## Syllabus Description
This class explores computational models of simple nervous systems (Such as C. Elegans and pleurobranch), and how 
the dynamics of these nervous systems can be used as models of control systems for robotics.
